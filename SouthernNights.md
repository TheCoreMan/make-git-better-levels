# Southern Nights - Glen Campbell

Songwriters: Allen Toussain

Southern Nights Have You Ever Felt A
Southern Night Free As A Breeze
Not To Mention The Trees
Whistling Tunes That You Know And Love So
Southern Nights Just As Good Even When
Closed Your Eyes I Apologize
To Any One Who Can Truly Say
He Has Found A Better Way
Feel So Good Feel So Good It's Frightening
Wish I Could Stop This World From Fighting
La Da Da Da Da Da La Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
Mysteries Like This And Many Others
In The Trees Blow In The Night
In The Southern Skies
Southern Skies Have You Ever Noticed
Southern Skies It's Precious Beauty
Lies Just Beyond The Eye
It Goes Running Thru Your Soul Like The Stories Of Old
Old Man He And His Dog They Walk The Old Land
Every Flower Touched His Cold Hand
As He Slowly Walked By
Weeping Willows Would Cry For Joy
